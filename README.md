# Reassessing multidecadal trends in Water Clarity for the central and southern California Current System
Starting on June 23, 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a NASA intern for the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP). During SARP, I was privileged enough to fly onboard NASA's P3 and B200 flying science laboratories, collecting atmospheric data using various remote sensing instruments. For eight weeks, I conducted an ocean remote sensing research campaign focusing on a decadal evaluation of variations in Secchi depth collected by CalCOFI. In this project, I aimed to determine how water clarity in the southern California current system has changed from 2007-2021 and propose possible explanations and ecological implications for my findings.

During the duration of this project, I had the privilege of being advised by Henry Houskeeper, Lori Berberian, and [Disha Sardana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/disha-sardana/).

## Abstract
Over the past several decades, the world has witnessed a steady rise in average global temperatures, a clear indication of the
escalating effects of climate change. In 1990, Andrew Bakun hypothesized that unequal warming of sea and land surface
temperatures would increase pressure gradients and lead to rising rates of alongshore upwelling within Eastern Boundary
Currents, including the California Current System (CCS). An anticipated increase in upwelling-favorable winds would have
profound implications for the productivity of the CCS, wherein upwelled waters supply nutrient injections that sustain and fuel
coastal ocean phytoplankton stocks. Increasing upwelling, therefore, is anticipated to increase the turbidity of the upper ocean,
corresponding with greater phytoplankton concentrations. Historical observations of turbidity are supported by observations
obtained using a Secchi Disk, i.e., an opaque white instrument lowered into the water column. Observations of Secchi depth—or
the depth at which light reflected from the Secchi Disk is no longer visible from the surface—provide a quantification of light
penetration into the euphotic zone. The shoaling, or shallowing, of Secchi disk depths was previously reported for inshore,
transition, and offshore waters of the central and southern CCS for historical observations spanning 1969 - 2007. Here, we
reassess Secchi disk depths during the subsequent period spanning 2007 to 2021 and test for more recent changes in water
clarity. Additionally, we evaluate the seasonality and spatial patterns of Secchi disk trends to test for potential changes to
oceanic microbial ecology. Indications of long-term trends in some of the coastal domains assessed were found. Generally, our
findings suggest a reversal of the trends previously reported. In particular, increases in water clarity likely associated with a
recent marine heatwave (MHW) may be responsible for recent changes in Secchi disk depth observations, illustrating the
importance of MHW events for modifying the CCS microbial ecosystem.
